## Common issues and Problems in PC:

### GPU (Graphics processor unit):
- Responsible for rendering graphics and visual output.
- Problems include overheating, driver issues, screen tearing, or no display output.

### PCU (Personal Computer Unit):
1. Installation & Hard Disk Preparation:<br>

* Partitioning: The first step of Partitinong is to organize the hard disk into:
  * **Primary (C: Drive):** <br>
    - Where the Operating System (Windows/Linux/Unix) is installed.
    - Avoid storing personal/important files in **C:**
      - If Windows crashes, files in D:, E:, F: are safer and can often be recovered.
  * **Logical Drives (D:, E:, F:):** Used for pictures, videos, documents, etc.

2. Speed slow (Causes & Fixes): <br>
-	Desktop: Files should be on drive. By default files on desktop are stored on C drive. As OS system is installed in C: file, its recomended to not put many folders in Desktop. Move them into drives. 

-	Task bar: Keep minimal shortcuts on the taskbar 

-	Browser (Bookmarks): Avoid excessive browser bookmarks as they slow down browser start-up.

-	Temporary files: These files are created by websites & cookies, and stored/ download in hidden files. Ulitmately because of it the system slows down.  So, after a period of time remove temporary files.

- RAM overuse: Don't open a number of applications or tabs are open at once. As ulitimately we are using the RAM.

-	Malware: Regularly scan your system for malwares.

-	Fragmentation: <br>
    There shouldn’t be chaos or dely to access files. <br>
    To make system efficient in working and get work done in optimal way, defragmentation is done.<br>
    * Go to `Start → Defragment and Optimize Drives`
    * Schedule defragmentation for automatic optimization.

4. Printer Issues & Solutions:
   
| Problem                            | Solution                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|  Paper Jam                       | Remove the stuck page carefully           |
|  Printer Out of Paper During Print Job | Use Queue.                 |
|  Faded or Poor Quality Prints   | Refill or replace ink/toner               |
|  Overlapping Lines in Print      | Possible **drum issue**, replace the drum |

###  Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):
It is used to indicate a system crash, in which the operating system reaches a critical condition where it can no longer operate safely.

**Common Causes of BSOD:**

1. Hardware Failures: <br>
   Faulty RAM, hard disk, or other internal components
2. Driver Issues: <br>
   Outdated, incompatible, or corrupted device drivers
4. Corrupted System Files: <br>
   System file corruption due to improper shutdowns, malware, or failed updates
5. Overheating or Power Issues: <br>
   Inadequate cooling or power supply malfunctions

###  System Crash Analysis:

After a BSOD, Windows creates a **dump file** that records what happened before the crash.

### Tools for Analysis:
1. **Event Viewer:** <br>
   Windows tool to check detailed system and crash logs.
2. **WinDbg:** <br>
   Microsoft Debugging Tool for analyzing dump files    |
   
### BIOS/UEFI Settings and POST Errors:

| BIOS                      | UEFI                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Basic Input/Output System | Unified Extensible Firmware Interface |
| Older firmware standard   | Modern replacement for BIOS           |
| Keyboard-only navigation  | Supports mouse and GUI                |
| Stored in ROM chip        | Stored in flash memory                |

BIOS/UEFI is responsible for initializing hardware components before the OS loads.


**What is POST?:** <br>
POST (Power-On Self Test) is a diagnostic process that occurs when the computer is powered on. It checks for:

* RAM functionality
* CPU status
* Keyboard presence
* Display detection
* Hard disk and drives

*Common POST Errors:*

| Beep Code / Message   | Meaning                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Long, 2 Short Beeps | Graphics card issue                                       |
| Continuous Beeps      | RAM failure                                               |
| No Beep, No Display   | Power or motherboard issue                                |
| “CMOS Checksum Error” | Corrupted BIOS settings (usually fixed by resetting CMOS) |

### Accessing BIOS/UEFI Settings

* Press **F2**, **F10**, **DEL**, or **ESC** continously during startup (key depends on manufacturer).
* From here, you can:

  * Change boot order
  * Enable/disable hardware components
  * View system info
  * Reset settings to default (if needed)
