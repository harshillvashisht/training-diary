## Networking Basics
**Network Definition:** <br>
  Any time two or more hosts are connected and can communicate, you have a network.


### 1. Hosts and Traffic:

* **Host:**
   Host is any device which sends or receive data traffic over a network. While often a computer, it can also include other networked devices like smartphones, tablets, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
* **Client:**
   Client is a host that initiates requests for services from another device on the network.
* **Server:**
   Server is a computer designed to respond to requests from clients. It "serves" the requested data or services to the user.
* **Traffic:**
   It refers to the data that is transmitted between devices on a network. This can include anything from web pages and emails to video streams and sensor data from IoT devices.

### 2. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):

An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

* **Protocol:**
   Protocol is a set of rules governing how data is formatted, transmitted, and received between devices.
* **Properties:**
    * **Unique:** Each device on a network must have a unique IP address.
    * **Universal:** IP addresses are a globally recognized standard for network communication.
* **Types:**
    * **Public IP Address:** Used on the internet, these addresses are globally unique and routable.
    * **Private IP Address:** Used within private networks (e.g., home or school networks), these addresses are not directly routable on the internet.
* **Dynamic Nature:** IP address can change over time, especially for devices on dynamic IP assignments. However, its fundamental properties (uniqueness and universality) remain constant.

### 3. IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4):

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol.

* **Length:** 32 bits long.
* **Address Space:** Can theoretically support $2^{32}$ unique addresses.
* **Notation:** Represented in dotted-decimal format, consisting of four **octets** (groups of 8 bits) separated by dots. Each octet can range from 0 to 255.
    * Example: `192.168.1.1`
 
#### Address Structure:

* **Network ID (Prefix):**
   Defines the network segment to which the device belongs. This part is common for all devices within the same network.
* **Host ID (Suffix):**
  Uniquely identifies a specific device (host) within that network segment.

*Example*:
An international phone number where the country code represent network and the phone number represents the "host."

### 4. IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)

IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, designed to address the limitations of IPv4, primarily the exhaustion of available addresses.

* **Length:** 128 bits long.
* **Address Space:** Can support a vastly larger number of addresses, approximately $2^{128}$.
* **Notation:** Represented in hexadecimal, often with colons separating groups of 16 bits.


### 5. Classful Addressing (IPv4)

It is used to categorizing IP addresses into different classes based on the range of their first octet. There are five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.


| **Class** | **Starting Bits** | **IP Range** | **Length of Network (Bits)** | Reseved bits  | Number of Networks | Number of Hosts     | **Default Subnet Mask** | Purpose                                |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------  | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------     | ----------------------- | -----------------------------------------------|
| **A**     | 0                 | 0 - 126      | 8                            | First         | $2^{7}$ = 128         |  $2^{24}$ = 16 million | 255.0.0.0               | Very large organizations. exp: Indian railways |
| **B**     | 10                | 128 – 191    | 16                           |  First 2      | $2^{14}$              |  $2^{16}$               | 255.255.0.0             | Medium-sized organizations                      |
| **C**     | 110               | 192 – 223    | 24                           |   First 3     | $2^{21}$               |  $2^{8}$ = 256         | 255.255.255.0           | Small networks (like LANs)                       |
| **D**     | 1110              | 224 – 239    | N/A (Multicast)              |         N/A   |N/A                 | N/A                 | N/A                     | Multicast groups                               |
| **E**     | 1111              | 240– 255     | Reserved                     |     N/A       |N/A                 | N/A                 | N/A                     | Experimental or research use only                   |

*Note: As the prefix (network ID) increases, the number of available host IDs decreases*


### 6. Broadcast vs. Multicast vs. Unicast

| **Parameters**             | **Unicast**                                                                  | **Broadcast**                                                         | **Multicast**                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basics**                 | There is only **one receiver** and **one sender**.                           | There are **multiple receivers** and **one sender**.                  | There are **multiple receivers** and **multiple senders**.                          |
| **Meaning and Definition** | Unicast is used to transfer data from a single sender to a single recipient. | Broadcast sends data from one sender to **all devices** on a network. | Multicast sends data from one or more senders to a **selected group** of receivers. |
| **Mapping**                | **One-to-one** type of communication.                                        | **One-to-many** type of communication.                                | **Many-to-many** type of communication.                                             |
| **Uses**                   | Used for **direct communication** like web browsing, emails, etc.            | Used in **TV/radio networks**, ARP, DHCP discovery, etc.              | Used in **stock exchanges**, **live video streaming**, **multimedia delivery**.     |

### 7. Subnetting:
* Dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks. It helps to utilize the network bandwidth in more intelligent way.
* **Bandwidth:** Capacity of network; data transmission rate (e.g., Mbps). Should be maximum.
* **Latency:** Delay in data transmission. Should be minimum.

  
* **Host Bits:** Denoted by '0's in subnet mask.
* **Network IP:** First IP of a subnet (cannot be assigned to host).
* **Broadcast IP:** Last IP of a subnet (cannot be assigned to host).

### Some other small concepts:
#### MAC (Media Access Control Address)

* **Nature:** A unique, 12-character hexadecimal (alphanumeric) attribute used to identify individual electronic devices on a network.
* **Distinction from IP Address:**
    * **MAC Address:** Identifies the physical location of a device within a *local network*. It's like your permanent home address. The manufacturer provides it.
    * **IP Address:** Signifies the device's *global or internet-accessible identity*. It's more like a temporary vacation rental address, changing depending on your network connection.

####  DNS (Domain Name System):
It is a naming system for computers, service etc connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates domain names (`www.google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (`172.217.160.142`).

#### Default Gateway:
Its a device (typically a router) that acts as a pathway for data to leave a local network and reach other networks, including the internet.


####  CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
* Modern method for IP allocation and routing, replacing classful addressing with more flexible network sizing (e.g., `/24`).

#### Types of Cables
* **Twisted Pair:**
    * **Types:** Shielded (STP) and Unshielded (UTP).
    * **Use:** LANs (Ethernet).
* **Coaxial:**
    * **Use:** TV networks, older computer networks.
* **Fiber-Optic:**
    * **Use:** High-speed networks, long distances (most commonly used today).
 
## Numericals:
### For `205.150.65.0/26`. Find:
1. Subset mask
2. Number of subsets
3. Number of hosts
4. Network IP
5. Broadcast IP.
### Answer:
*Here /26 is CIDR*
**Class:** Class C.
1. **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.192`
    * In binary: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000`
    * This means 26 bits are used for the network.
    * Convering `11000000` to decimal = $2^{7}$ + $2^{6}$  = 192
    * SO Subset mask is: `255.255.255.192`

2. **Number of Subnets:**
     * 26 network bits - 24 default network bits = 2 subnet bits
     * Number of subnets = $2^{\text{subnet bits}} = 2^2 = 4$

3. **Number of Hosts**
    * **Host ID Bits:** 32 - 26 = 6
    * Number of hosts = $2^{\text{host bits}} - 2 = 2^6 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62$

4. **Network IP:**
   - Given IP `AND` (AND operation) Subset mask:
    - 205.105.65.0

5. **Broadcast IP:**
   - As maximum number of hosts are 62:
   - `205.105.65.63`
