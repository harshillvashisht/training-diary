## Networking Commands and Concepts

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
- It is a network protocol that automates IP address assignment to devices on a network.
  
### Network Commands:
**`ping`**
  * **Meaning (Simple):** "Hey, are you there?" It's used to check if another computer, server, or website is currently online and reachable from your PC.
  * **Technical Meaning:** `ping` sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packets to a target host.
       -  If a reply is received, the host is "alive".
       -  Otherwise, its blocked.
  * **Syntax:** `ping website_address`
      * **Example:** `ping google.com`
      * **To Exit:** Press `Ctrl + C` in the command prompt/terminal.

  * **Loopback Address (`127.0.0.1`):**
      * This IP always refers to "yourself" â€“ your own computer.
      * It's used to test the network configuration of your local PC.
      * **Example:** Like sending a letter to your own house to test if your mailbox works.

**`traceroute` (Windows: `tracert`)**
  * It shows the exact path your data takes from your computer to a website or server, revealing every "hop" (router) along the way. Each hop represents a router that the data packet passes through.
  * **Syntax:** `traceroute <hostname_or_IP_address>` (on macOS/Linux) or `tracert <hostname_or_IP_address>` (on Windows)
  * **`***` (Asterisks) in Output:** It indicates that the router at that hop did not reply.

**`ipconfig` (Windows) / `ifconfig` (macOS/Linux)**
  * **`ipconfig` (Windows):**
      * Shows the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and other network settings that your Windows computer is currently using.

      
  * **`ifconfig` (macOS/Linux):**
      * Provides:
        
  | **Term**    | **Represents**                                 |
  | ----------- | -----------------------------------------------|
  | `inet`      | IP address                                     |
  | `netmask`   | Network range   |
  | `lo0`       | Loopback         |
  | `broadcast` | Address used to send messages to all devices. |


### Ethernet:
It is used to connect devices with a physical cable so that they can communicate or access.
  * **How it Works:**
    1.  Plug one end of an Ethernet cable into your PC's network port.
    2.  Plug the other end of the cable into a modem or router.
    3.  Your PC can now communicate over the network and access the internet.

#### Ethernet vs. Wi-Fi:

| Feature    | Ethernet                    | Wi-Fi                   |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Signal** | Through cable (copper, fiber) | Through air (radio waves)                |
| **Speed** |  faster | Varies, can be slower than wired         |
| **Stability** | More stable | Can be affected by walls, distance. |
| **Security** | More secure  | Less secure |
| **Mobility** | No (wired)    | Yes (moves freely) |

### Comparison of Network Types

| **Network Type** | **Definition**                                                              | **Type**                  |                                         
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Ethernet** | A specific **wired** technology for local area networking.                          | LAN Technology (Wired)    |
| **Wi-Fi**    | A specific **wireless** technology  for local area networking.                      | LAN Technology (Wireless) | 
| **LAN**      | A network connecting devices within a limited area (e.g., home, office).            | Local Network             |
| **WAN**      | A network that spans a large geographical area, often connecting multiple **LANs**. | Wide Network              |
| **Internet** | A global system of interconnected networks using the Internet Protocol (IP) suite.  | Global WAN                |
